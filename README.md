The aim of this project is to digitalize ECG data. In particular, given an ECG image we want to turn it in digital form.

### What's in here?
- The notebook with all the code used to carry out the project `main.ipynb`
- A test image `ECG_TEST.jpg`

### Datasets
The only data needed are ECG images. We used only the test image in this repository.
